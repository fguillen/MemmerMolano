                Choose my own adventure – or is it yours? – deals with meeting processes and ideas of intimacy on the internet
                and in performance. By adopting codes and language of Eroticism, SM and Webcam chat sites, it attempts by a
                context shift, to make reactions, thoughts and feelings experiential.

                The question of reciprocity has a central role. Who dominates? Who feels pleasure? Who is available and who authorizes?
              </p>

              <p>
                The project has two sides: the web and the real site. In the website project, users are invited to design tasks and
                experienceable proposals for a character, which they can write down at the blog during a week. Every day an idea
                is chosen and the video produced and posted on the web the following day.

                In the live encounters, each guest has the possibility to create a scene and to experience it in the form of a 1:1
                meeting with the performer. Before each guest enters the room they will have to fill out a contract sheet in which
                they have to specify their wishes concerning lightening, music, clothes and ways of greeting. By entering the room
                the guest will encounter a video and bit by bit then witness the set up of his or her personal scene. With a drink,
                both guest and performer then negotiate the further procedure of the game. Cards are available to be played with.
                The guest decides how far to go.
